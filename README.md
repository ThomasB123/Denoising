# Non-Local Means Denoising

The non-local means algorithm was proposed in [1], as a simple yet effective image denoising method based on the principle of replacing the colour of a pixel with an average of the colours of ‘similar’ pixels.

Based on independent literature research, and experimentation with the OpenCV implementation of non-local means denoising fastNlMeansDenoisingColored(), write a report containing:

1. A description of the non-local means denoising algorithm.

2. Discussion of the various proposed implementations of the algorithm and discussion of their efficiency. You can start your research on implementation issues from [2].

3. Demonstration of the influence of the algorithmic parameters on the output.

4. Discussion of the strengths and limitations of non-local means compared to other denoising algorithms.

5. Description and discussion of modifications and extensions of the algorithm that have been proposed in the literature.

6. Description and discussion of applications of the original algorithm and its extensions.

The report should contain examples of images denoised by the OpenCV implementation of the algorithm. You can use the Python program uploaded on DUO and fine-tune its parameters.
